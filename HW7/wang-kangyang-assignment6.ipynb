Then, I calculated the mean square footage under the condition as the selected label value to be printed when the users make selections on the heatmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Before passing the data to the histogram/bar plot, I grouped the selected data frame by the \"Year Acquired\" and calculated the \"Square Footage\" sum as the total square footage. And I assigned the index of the sum grouped results as the x-axis of the histogram and the values as the y axis of the histogram.\n",

    "**Q2. How you dealt with NaN's (empty entries) in your dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "I transformed all the NaNs in the original building inventory dataset as zeros while reading the CSV datafile as a pandas data frame. Moreover, to generate the pivot table before plotting the heatmap, I also got Nans in my unstacked grouped results, and I filled all NaNs with zeros in my dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. Any aesthetic choices you made (colors, layout, plot size, label size) and why, and what you'd like to experiment with if you had more time.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I selected the color scheme as \"plasma\" since it has more contrasts than a single color with a white background. From the above heatmap plotting, I can quickly identify some special cells with bright yellow or orange colors, which alerts me with some exceptional cases with the outstanding number of buildings built for a certain agency in a certain county.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After plotting my first heatmap, I noticed there are overlaps in both x and y axes and in the y-label and the y-tickers. In order to solve this problem, I first rotated the x ticks by 90 degrees to show them vertically and sized down the font of x and y ticks to 8 while identifying the axes in plotting. Then, I set the label_offset value of the y-axis as \"150px\" to make the y-label \"Agency Name\" stay further from the y axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the final step of combining the heatmap and histogram side by side, I set the figure margins as (top=50, bottom=40, left=200, right=60) to make everything visible on the canvas. And since there are too many grids in the heatmap, to make the cells visible and easy to be selected, I set the minimum width of the heatmap layout to 1500px and the minimum width of the histogram layout to 600px.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things I would like to experiment with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instead of showing the heatmap and the histogram side by side, I would like to check whether I can only temporarily show the histogram above the selected cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I think the \"County\" might be too detailed in analyzing the distribution of buildings. Maybe \"State\" would be a better unit in analyzing. And I can perhaps try a US map shape heatmap to show the distributions of buildings all over the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Instead of plotting the histogram to show the total square footage acquired for each year, I can also plot the scatter plot to show the square footage acquired/constructed each year to discover the pattern/trend.\n"
